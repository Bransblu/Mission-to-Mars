# Mission-to-Mars


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to scrape a mars hemisphere website to create a website with five total images and a facts table. An app.py file was created to connect to mongo and communicate with scraping.py file and the mongo database. 

## Challenges
Retrieving the hemisphere images by parsing through the website using Splinter and BeautifulSoup was a challenge in terms of clicking a url, pulling an image, and cycling to the next 3 images.

# Result
The mongo db was connected to by using Flask, and it successfuly updated the webpage to reflect changes made to both the python application and the html code in the index file.
